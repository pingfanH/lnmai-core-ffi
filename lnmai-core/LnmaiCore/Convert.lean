  Grade conversion: maps the raw 15-tier judgment to a reduced grade
  depending on the selected difficulty mode (JudgeStyle).

  Fully structural — no LT/LE comparisons needed.

-- Theorems
--   Note: these conversion functions are NOT idempotent for all inputs
--   (e.g. Maji maps LateGreat3rd→LateGood→Miss on second application).
--   They are applied exactly once per note in the game.
--   We prove what we can: fixed points and structural properties.
